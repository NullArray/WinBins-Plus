Repo to store Windows PE's and Utilities for easy access.
----------------------------------------------------------

This repo was created as a place to store a number of Windows PE's, Utilities and Tools for easy access. When deploying a new Windows install i usually spend a good amount of time simply looking for and installing the tools i need. I can be a little disorganized at times, so i figured i'd put these here to save myself a lot of hassle. It might save you a bit of hassle as well, if you're looking for something specific.

### Update

In the PenTest Directory i have uploaded some pre-built PE's that might come in handy during an active engagement where a
Windows box is theprimary target.
 
### Note


Credit for the available utilities goes to the original authors of course as well as the entity's they represent respectively, as stated, this is simply a list of binaries and installers curated by me for our convenience.

Regardless, should you have any questions surrounding the contents and/or purpose of this repo please feel free to open a ticket.
