## Windows OPSEC 

Here is a little something to frustrate Micro$oft user data mining efforts. 
A PAC Script, A PowerShell HTTP Server to serve the PAC Data, a batch file to remove Telemetry related updates 
and commands to manually add a scheduled task ro start at log on and persistently do so.

### Note

These scripts are somewhat of an Alpha release. Expension amd updates are forthcoming.
